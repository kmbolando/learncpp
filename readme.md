# Learning C++
Learning the C++ Language at [learncpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com/)

## Dependencies
I compiled all the C++ code on my Ubuntu Linux/GNU;
The Following packages are needed:
#### Essentials
* `build-essential` This package installs the C/C++ libraries to your Linux/GNU system to create C/C++ programs.
* `g++` GNU C++ Compiler
 * `gcc` can also be an alternate but you have to type in `gcc -xc++ -lstdc++ -shared-libgcc`
* `VIM, nano, gedit, emacs` (or any preferable text editor)

#### IDE w/ GUI
These are are optional and work as an alternative to the Microsoft's Visual C++/Virtual Studio (since those programs aren't available on Linux/GNU Systems)
* `apatana` Prefered IDE
* `codeblocks` Another good alternative
